I created each warehouse in the Databricks UI.
Besides the warehouse size, the only other change I made to default settings was to set the sleep time to 5 minutes to save money (the 4x large warehouse is very expensive). 

Once the warehouse was created, I'd save the warehouse path to use in the .env file for each run.
