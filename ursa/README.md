# Ursa

Ursa is a research project based on ClickHouse to make ClickHouse faster than Umbra.

The goal is to research all possible optimizations, even if they are backward incompatible with original ClickHouse. If
some of them will be useful and provide a lot of performance improvements, they can be backported to ClickHouse with keeping backward compatibility.
